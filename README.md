# CUDA PTX Simple Sample

This is a hello world sample to illstrate how to write a ptx source and a CUDA source and then build the whole program.

The function in the PTX source just calculate the sum of the two specified vectors for each element.

This example uses CUDA 11 SDK toolkit and Visual Studio 2019. Before running `build.bat`, put the MSVC compiler program `cl.exe` into the `Path` environment variable.
